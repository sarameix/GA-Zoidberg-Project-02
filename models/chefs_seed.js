        bio: "Over three decades ago, with my GED in hand and a helping hand from a most generous restaurateur, I set out to learn a trade. I was a member of French Culinary Institute's first graduating class of 1984 and it was there I learned the fundamentals I so needed. That formal education and a three year stint with Chef Jonathan Waxman in the mid to late '80's are the two experiences I point to most when reflecting about how I got my start. They outfitted me with the confidence I needed to take my own shot. Over the years, I've been able to play out my culinary dreams like an artist â€” approaching concepts that were speaking to me at that very moment. I'm excited to see what happens next.",
