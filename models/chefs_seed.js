        name: "Guy Fieri",
        bio: "Before I was the likeable, laid-back California guy with my trademark bleached-blond spiky hair, I began my love affair with food at the age of 10. I sold soft pretzels from a three-wheeled bicycle cart (named “The Awesome Pretzel”) that I built with my father. By selling pretzels and washing dishes, I earned enough money in six years to study abroad as an exchange student in Chantilly, France. There, I gained a profound appreciation for international cuisine and the lifestyle associated with it. I attended University of Nevada Las Vegas, where he graduated with a bachelor’s degree in hospitality management. In 2006, I premiered my first show, Guy's Big Bite, and the rest is history.",

        name: "Bobby Flay",
        bio: "Over three decades ago, with my GED in hand and a helping hand from a most generous restaurateur, I set out to learn a trade. I was a member of French Culinary Institute's first graduating class of 1984 and it was there I learned the fundamentals I so needed. That formal education and a three year stint with Chef Jonathan Waxman in the mid to late '80's are the two experiences I point to most when reflecting about how I got my start. They outfitted me with the confidence I needed to take my own shot. Over the years, I've been able to play out my culinary dreams like an artist — approaching concepts that were speaking to me at that very moment. I'm excited to see what happens next.",

        name: "Rachael Ray",
        bio: "Growing up in a family steeped in culinary tradition, I was exposed to a wide range of cooking techniques, from my maternal grandfather who grew and cooked everything his family of 12 ate, to my dad's family, which embraced the food-rich traditions of Louisiana. My family owned several restaurants on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, before relocating to upstate New York, where my mother worked as the food supervisor for a restaurant chain. After moving to New York and managing a few markets, I moved back upstate, started doing cooking classes, and eventually got signed on to do my first show. I've been cooking on tv ever since.",
