This repository contains a full stack web application created for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course. This site was created using Node.js and Express connected to a MongoDB database, and it was deployed using Heroku. To view the live site, click on the link above.<br/> 

The purpose of this application is for all home cooks to feel like professionals. They can post detailed information about their recipes and also maintain a profile page that shares a little information about them and their background. The recipe pages are super detailed, and users can share an image, introductory paragraph, ingredient lists, and as many directions as necessary. All chef profile pages are linked in their recipes, and all of a chef's recipes are linked in their profile.<br/> 

The biggest struggle I faced during this project was getting a relationship between chef and recipe models working. It took a lot of MongoDB setup and very specific calls to the database to get everything working, but I was able to achieve the link between models that I was looking for.<br/> 

I also put time into adjusting the elements on the website to be responsive on desktop. Unfortunately, the application is not as responsive as I would like it to be on mobile, but it reformats and resizes all elements as you scale the window up and down on desktop.
